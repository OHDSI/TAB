### Concept Set

A **Concept Set** is a JSON structure used in the **OHDSI** (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) community to define and manage a standardized collection of medical concepts. Concept Sets are typically used to specify collections of standardized vocabulary concepts for use in observational research, cohort definitions, and analytics, enabling consistent identification of clinical phenomena across different healthcare databases.
