The OHDSI Technical Advisory Board meets the first Friday of each month at 10:30 AM EST. This site serves as an account of topics discussed and general guidance that is offered by the TAB.

[2024 Meeting Notes](2024-Meeting-Notes.md) : Our raw meeting notes are in the process of being migrating to this location from our existing MS Teams for easier dissemination. They will be distilled down to articles that sumamrize and provide guidance on the topics discussed and recommended by the TAB. This is still a work in progress.
