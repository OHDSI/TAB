The OHDSI Technical Advisory Board is focused on guiding and supporting the technical development of OHDSI open source projects. Comprising experts from the OHDSI community and external partners, the TAB works to ensure the stability, security, supportability, and sustainability of OHDSI open source projects. 

The OHDSI Technical Advisory Board meets the first Friday of each month at 10:30 AM EST. This site serves as an account of topics discussed and general guidance that is offered by the TAB.
